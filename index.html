    <h1>Subtopic 1.1.1 Mindset and Agility</h1>
    
    <img src="images/Banner.png" class="img-fluid" />


    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    
    <p>Before you can practice something new, whether it is learning to juggle or forming a cutting-edge marketing strategy, you must first know yourself. Setting underlying goals and motivations in your mind allows you to act with purpose (even if you happen to drop the ball.)</p>
    
    <p>This subtopic will provide you with:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Tools to shift your mindset from a fixed to growth position.</li>
        <li>Ways to improve your spoken dialogue to direct yourself and others towards solutions.</li>
        <li>The vision to recognise common barriers to working effectively by monitoring experiences and moods.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Prepare your mind</h1>

    <img src="icons/prepare_your_mind.jpg" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>
    
    <p>Stretching has been shown to relieve stress and reduce anxiety. That means it&rsquo;s perfect for improving your mood and state of mind before learning something new!</p>
    
    <p>Get ready for this subtopic by following along with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAUf7aajBWE">Yoga at Your Desk</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Hint: </em>Your body and mood have a significant impact on the way that you take on new information. Benefits of stretching include:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Stress relief</li>
        <li>Improved digestion</li>
        <li>Lessen headaches</li>
        <li>Improved posture</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Your mindset</h1>

    <p>Agile, as its name suggests, supports your ability to respond dynamically to change. We are all too familiar with the ever-shifting nature and chaos of life at home and work. Phrases such &ldquo;something has come up&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made a mistake&rdquo; or &ldquo;we now have less time&rdquo; are commonplace. Approaching issues with flexibility and pragmatism sounds simple (and is certainly freeing) in theory, but it goes against how we as human beings have traditionally thought and behaved when working on a task or project.</p>
    
    <p>The most important factor for personal or professional success is your mindset. What you consistently believe and think about has a direct impact on your behaviour. Behaviour that includes your interactions with problems, new information, and other people.</p>
    
    <p>There are two ways of viewing ability or intelligence.</p>
    
    <p><strong>A fixed mindset: </strong>Ability it is fixed or ingrained &ndash; in other words, we are born with a certain level of ability and we cannot change that.</p>
    
    <p><strong>A growth mindset:</strong> We can develop our ability through hard work and effort.</p>
    
    <h1>Fixed mindset</h1>

    <img src="icons/fixed_mindset.jpg" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>
    
    <p>In a fixed mindset, people believe their qualities are fixed traits and therefore cannot change. These people document their intelligence and talents rather than working to develop and improve them. They also believe that talent alone leads to success, and effort is not required.</p>
    
    <p>People with a fixed mindset tend to spend a lot of their time and effort to prove their worth and intelligence because they believe that they have a set amount.</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Sticking with what you know &ndash; staying safe</li>
        <li>Giving up when things go wrong</li>
        <li>Telling yourself that you are not smart enough when things go wrong</li>
        <li>Not taking responsibility for failures</li>
        <li>Failing to see the lesson or an opportunity for growth</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Growth mindset</h1>

    <img src="icons/growth_mindset.jpg" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>

    <p>In a growth mindset, people have an underlying belief that their learning and intelligence can grow with time and experience. When people believe they can become smarter, they realize that their effort influences their success, so they put in extra time, leading to higher achievement.</p>
    
    <p>People with a growth mindset believe their abilities and intelligence can be developed with effort, learning, and persistence. Their basic abilities are simply a starting point for their potential. They don't believe everyone is the same, but they hold onto the idea that everyone can improve if they try.</p>
    
    <p>Examples:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Learning something new and being committed to lifelong learning</li>
        <li>Doing something that takes you outside your comfort zone</li>
        <li>Running an experiment to learn something new</li>
        <li>Being curious when things go wrong</li>
        <li>Understanding that your skills are not fixed</li>
        <li>View challenges as opportunities to learn</li>
        <li>Being flexible in your approach or belief about things &ndash; not being too anchored to previous thinking, particularly when working with others</li>
        <li>Understand that things take time and you have to stick with things over a period of time</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    
    <h1>Locating Yourself - A Key to Conscious Leadership</h1>
    
    <p>One way to examine and change your mindset over time is to ask yourself where you are in any present moment. Are you approaching the situation with growth in mind? or are you fixating on what cannot be changed?</p>
    
    <p>Reflect on this as you watch this video from The Conscious Leadership Group which explores the idea of being either above or below the line.</p>

    <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" style="max-width: 560px;">
        <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fLqzYDZAqCI" width="560" height="315" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>

    <h1>Words have power</h1>
    
    <p>A fixed mindset will more often put you below the line as the video described. We have already established that the way you think, your internal dialogue, has an impact on your behaviour and the results you get. Your chosen words have the same power.</p>
    
    <p>Someone acting from below the line will generally make reference to external people and events such as &ldquo;you&rdquo;, &ldquo;him&rdquo;, &ldquo;her&rdquo;, &ldquo;he&rdquo;, &ldquo;she&rdquo;, &ldquo;it&rdquo;, &ldquo;them&rdquo; or &ldquo;they&rdquo;. Living below the line is a form of living in the past and fixating on problems instead of new solutions.</p>

    <br/><br/>
    
    <p>A growth mindset will put you above the line. By using dialogue that is inclusive you will naturally start to act responsibly. Your inner monologue and how you then communicate can instead have a greater focus on the future and possible solutions&nbsp; - language such as &ldquo;I&rdquo;, &ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;me&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;.</p>

    <h1>Activity</h1>
    
    <h3>Where was your head at?</h3>
    
    <p>Think of a time when you have had either a fixed or growth mindset.</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>What were the circumstances?</li>
        <li>What did you tell yourself about the situation?</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p><em>Hint: </em><em>Consider what your inner dialogue was like in that situation or in general. Were there other people and reactions involved? What was the end result?</em></p>
    
    <h1>How to adopt a growth mindset</h1>
    
    <p>Shifting your mindset is a continuous journey and is difficult because it goes against our cautious and risk fearing nature. No one person is the same, which makes self-reflection and practice necessary as you fluctuate between a fixed and growth mindset in whatever the context might be.</p>
    
    <p>But here is the good news - you are already taking on&nbsp; a growth mindset by doing this course! By learning something, by sharing with others and by testing past beliefs you are paving new ways of thinking and tackling tasks. Some things to keep in mind as you continue your Agile voyage:</p>
    
    <h3>Accept that change happens</h3>
    
    <p>Change is inevitable and learning to embrace change and being open to possibilities is both healthy and an urgent necessity. Without innovation, without development and without change, companies and the individual lives that contribute to them would ultimately stagnate and would never survive, let alone grow.</p>
    
    <h3>Prove instead of theorise</h3>
    
    <p>Most of the time you won&rsquo;t want to simply talk&nbsp; about the theories behind Agile and a growth mindset, people want to experience the value of change. The key is to act. Experimenting and working towards small changes like prototypes or improving existing tools will give you powerful examples to learn from and show others.</p>
    
    <h3>Give it time</h3>
    
    <p>Change doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight. Changing mindsets is often slow and requires hard work, and often results are expected straight away. A growth mindset and Agile transformation will allow you to work more effectively (speed being one of the benefits), but only when it is properly understood and monitored over time.</p>
    
    <p>It&rsquo;s common to try and change everything at once, and feeling disheartened when it often fails. Pace yourself. It is vital to start with incremental steps, and accept that going fast sometimes means taking it slow.</p>
    
    <h3>Collaborate and trust others</h3>
    
    <p>The saying &ldquo;faster alone, further together&rdquo; summarises the benefits of trust. Continuous collaboration and making decisions together ensures that there is a firm foundation for moving through barriers in the way of change. Invest your time in communicating frequently and openly, and bring people with you on the journey to foster growth through personal responsibility.</p>
    
    <h1>Workplace Example</h1>
    
    <p>Consider an organisation undergoing rapid change that impacts culture, process and systems.&nbsp; Many organisations are experiencing this as their organisations seek to embed technology as a means to be more efficient and effective when delivering services and products.&nbsp; Changing people is always challenging, and some people cope better than others. Consider two scenarios:</p>
    
    <img src="icons/Julie.png" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>
    <p>Julie is a team leader of about 15 sales staff.&nbsp; A new system is about to be implemented which will impact the way her team does their work.&nbsp; Julie is quite wedded to the way they have always done things. When working with the team implementing the system, she refuses to accept a system that does not resemble the way work happens today.&nbsp; As a result the team is unable to leverage some of the benefits of the system, particularly in relation to low value add activity.</p>
    
    <div class="clearfix"></div>

    <img src="icons/Brett.png" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>
    <p>Brett is a solid performer who works in a team of 6.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s always been curious in nature, in fact sometimes his stable job bores him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s constantly seeking ways that can help him be more effective. When opportunities for growth emerge, he is the first to put his hand up to try them out.&nbsp; When things don&rsquo;t go to plan, he considers what he could have done better.&nbsp;</p>
    
    <div class="clearfix"></div>

    <ul>
        <li>What outcomes would you expect based on the way these two people approach their work?</li>
        <li>What benefits can you extrapolate from having a growth mindset?</li>
        <li>How do you think others perceive these two people in the workplace?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h1>Fixed versus growth mindset</h1>
    
    <p>A focus on improvement instead of just performance changes your reaction to new information and challenging events. So what is the outcome?</p>
    
    <h3>A healthy self-esteem</h3>

    <img src="icons/a_healthy_self-esteem.jpg" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>
    
    <p>To achieve anything, you must first feel capable of achieving it. Self-esteem comes from your internal dialogue and dictates how you see your personal worth (for better or worse).</p>
    
    <p>A strong and positive mindset develops a healthy self-esteem by reinforcing positive beliefs, attitudes and feelings instead of criticism and doubt.</p>
    
    <div class="clearfix"></div>

    <h3>A winning perspective</h3>

    <img src="icons/a_winning_perspective.jpg" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>
    
    <p>Our perspective is the meaning we attach to the events and circumstances in our lives. The perspective we formulate plays a significant role on whether we take an optimistic or negative approach to problems. Tony Robbins notes that &ldquo;Nothing in life has any meaning except the meaning we give it.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>Having an optimistic mindset increases the likelihood of formulating a winning perspective and achieving long-term success.</p>
    
    <div class="clearfix"></div>

    <h3>Harnessing drive</h3>

    <img src="icons/harnessing_drive.jpg" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>
    
    <p>Without an unwavering kind of drive, it would be difficult to achieve any worthwhile goal. More than momentary motivation, real drive involves developing your winning perspective and sustaining the right amount of effort.</p>
    
    <p>A growth mindset awakens your personal power to commit to a higher purpose instead of wasting time grumbling over the circumstances. This type of focus urges someone to challenge the status quo and push past comfort zones.</p>
    
    <div class="clearfix"></div>

    <h3>Dealing with setbacks</h3>

    <img src="icons/dealing_with_setbacks.jpg" class="img-fluid" align="left"/>
    
    <p>We are often faced with the changing tides of adversity at work and in life. Often we might feel perfectly justified to surrender if obstacles their self-security. That&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s easier.</p>
    
    <p>The capacity to make another attempt, to try something different, is the sign of a resilient mindset that is hungry to learn from every misstep.</p>
    
    <div class="clearfix"></div>

    <h1>Readings</h1>
    
    <h3>Ways to develop a growth mindset</h3>
    
    <p>Carol Dweck (a Professor of Psychology at Stanford University) believes shifting to a growth mindset in response to external situations takes practice, self-awareness and and the belief in one&rsquo;s own potential.</p>

    <h1>Summary</h1>
    
    <p>Humans are wired in certain ways to perceive and act on threats. The primitive ways that we interpret the world around us require self-awareness to improve ourselves, and empathy to work with the motivations of others.</p>
    
    <p>Now knowing the way our brains respond to certain events, we have the clarity interrupt our personal instincts to set ourselves up for success and bring others along with us.</p>
    
    <p>You can now:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Deal with setbacks more effectively by having a healthy mindset of growth</li>
        <li>Wield responsibility-based language to reach solutions quicker.</li>
        <li>Harness your drive by accepting change and recognising when experimentation and collaboration is needed.</li>
    </ul>
